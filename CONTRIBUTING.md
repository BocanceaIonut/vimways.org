# Contributing to vimways.org

There are two non-exclusive ways to contribute to this project:

2. by reporting anything that seems broken in any way and, if possible, helping us fixing it.

## Submitting quality content

## Reporting broken windows

We don't want any typo, grammar issue, broken link, unreadable code block, snippets that don't work, or, heaven forbids, factual errors. Don't hesitate to open an issue on [our issue tracker][our-issue-tracker] if you see *anything* wrong with the site.
